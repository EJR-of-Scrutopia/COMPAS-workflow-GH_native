# The Bench

The bench is the VS Code half of this repository: everything that happens
to a design after the Grasshopper Export component writes its JSON. It
reads the plugin's exports headlessly, verifies them structurally,
tessellates them into masonry, views them, and writes results back to disk
as JSON. Rhino is never required.

The bench and the plugin never import each other's runtime. They exchange
files, and `tests/test_no_fea_cross_import.py` enforces the boundary in
both directions.

## What arrives from Grasshopper

The Export component writes two files per design, and the bench uses both:

- `<name>-contract.json` (Format=contract) is the whole solved Result:
  member forces, loads, reactions, supports, both diagrams, diagnostics.
  Everything numerical comes from here. Units are metres and kilonewtons
  with tension positive; the bench converts to SI base units exactly once,
  on read.
- `<name>-compas.json` (Format=compas) is `compas.data` geometry: the
  thrust mesh as a real Mesh with faces, plus the form and force graphs.
  Tessellation and shell modelling start from here.

Drop both into `bench/demo/upload from grasshopper/`. Anything that analyses an
export discovers the available pairs at runtime and never hard-codes a
file name; with no argument, the verification demo picks the export whose
own solver residual is smallest.

## The three environments

One interpreter cannot hold this ecosystem: compas_cra needs a pyomo that
needs Python 3.10 and numpy below 2, while the main bench mirrors Rhino
8's pins, and compas_fea2's OpenSees backend needs the core at a specific
git commit. So there are three, each built by a script:

| Environment | Python | Built by | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.venv` | 3.12 | `pip install -e ".[...]"` per the root README | numpy 2.0.2, scipy 1.13.1, compas 2.15.1, compas_fd, compas_tna, compas_dem, viewers |
| `.venv-cra` | 3.10 | `bench/scripts/setup_cra_env.sh` | compas_cra, pyomo 6.4.2, IPOPT via idaes |
| `.venv-fea` | 3.12 | `bench/scripts/setup_fea_env.sh` then `bench/scripts/install_opensees.py` | compas_fea2 @ 664ec20, compas_fea2_opensees, OpenSees 3.8 |

You never pick the interpreter yourself: every demo hands itself to the
environment it needs through `bench/demo/_bootstrap.py`, so the VS Code play
button works whatever the editor has selected. The FEA test suite collects
only where the OpenSees backend is installed, so `pytest` in the wrong
environment skips it rather than failing.

The FEA environment also needs a `.env` at the repository root pointing at
the OpenSees executable; `bench/scripts/install_opensees.py` writes it.

## The `ananke` terminal tool

`src/ananke_equilibrium/cli/`, installed with the main environment:

```text
ananke health              which capabilities this environment actually has
ananke check  <study>      validate a study folder before solving
ananke solve  <study>      run the worker headlessly, write the result
ananke describe <result>   solver, units, counts, diagnostics, residuals
ananke plot   <result>     form, force, and elevation diagrams (matplotlib)
ananke view   <result>     interactive 3D scene (compas_viewer)
ananke sweep  <study>      solve a family of load cases, compare
```

`describe` and `check` are the first thing to run on a new export: they
report the solver's own residual and whether loads and reactions cancel,
which tells you how far to trust everything downstream.

## The demos

`bench/demo/` holds nine clickable demos plus a gallery of upstream COMPAS
examples; the [demo runbook](../bench/demo/README.md) documents each one. The
short map:

```text
01 solve the pavilion        FD solve from a study folder, viewed
02 diagrams                  form and force diagrams from a result
03 load cases                sweep and compare
04 masonry blocks            tessellate a thrust surface into bricks
05 robot placing             analytical IK placing the vault's bricks
06 masonry gallery           compas_dem template shapes
07 compas official           upstream examples, run unmodified
08 your vault                read a real export, size it, tessellate it
09 structural verification   the engineer's answer; see below
```

## Structural verification, demo 09

`src/ananke_fea/` is the strand that answers whether the exported design
stands up. It runs only in `.venv-fea`. The demo, in order:

1. Reads the chosen export pair and reports units, supports, applied load,
   and the solver's own residual.
2. Cross-checks the FEA setup: the thrust network solved as a frame of
   deliberately slender beams under the export's exact loads. Reactions
   must balance the applied load; member forces are compared against TNA
   with the honest caveat that a quad network admits self-stress, so
   per-member equality is only expected on determinate fixtures.
3. Solves the shell under export loads plus the declared section's self
   weight (disclosed in the output, switchable), and reports stress
   utilisation and deflection.
4. Sweeps rising load factors for tension onset.
5. Sizes a provisional cable where tension appears, with its caveats
   attached.
6. Attempts the arc-length collapse trace and reports plainly that the
   backend cannot construct it at the current pin, rather than inventing
   a number.
7. Writes `bench/studies/<export-name>/fea-verification.json`.

Every claim in the strand is backed by a measurement one level simpler
than itself: the solver chain is proven against a cantilever's closed
form, member-force extraction against a tripod's statics, and the shell
stress conversion against plate-theory hand values.

The pinned compas_fea2 has several defects that report success while
returning wrong numbers; `src/ananke_fea/compat.py` documents each one and
carries the shims. Read its module docstring before touching anything in
the strand.

## Outputs

Analysis results land in `bench/studies/`, one folder per export name, as plain
JSON the main environment can read without any FEA packages. Every result
carries its own assumptions: material sources and factors, load
provenance, whether self weight was included, and notes on what each
check can and cannot falsify.

## The Studio

`bench/studio/serve.py` (play button or `.venv\Scripts\python.exe bench/studio/serve.py`)
serves http://127.0.0.1:8600: the presentation surface over the bench's
verified analysis. It reads the same export pairs as demo 09, treats the
funicular surface as falsework, and stages precast segments onto it rim to
crown.

- Study, material (C30/37 or GL24h), and a segmentation slider (4 to 16
  rings; wedge counts follow ring radius, staggered ring to ring).
- Run staged analysis: per stage, the falsework bookkeeping is exact
  arithmetic and the struck-now counterfactual is a real OpenSees solve in
  .venv-fea; stages that find no equilibrium say so.
- FEA layers: stress and deflection heatmaps (full per-element and
  per-node fields), load and reaction vectors, text overlays, the
  integrity pulse, thrust wires with node spheres.
- Placement animation with drop, orbit speed, and orbit distance sliders;
  the falsework strikes after the last segment lands.
- Record 1080p writes PNG frames through the server and stitches
  `recording.mp4` with ffmpeg.
- Column geometry dropped into `bench/studio/columns/*.json` (either
  `{"vertices", "faces"}` or a contract-style export) renders in steel.

Generated outputs live under `bench/studies/<slug>/studio/` and are not
committed. The server never imports the solver stacks; a guard test holds
it to that.
